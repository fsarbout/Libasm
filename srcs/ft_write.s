;the syscall takes to 6 arguments (6 registers , and it's doesn't
; use stack based arguments ), no arguments is passed directly to stack


;syscall() saves CPU registers before making the system call, 
;restores the registers upon return from the system call,
;and stores any error returned by the system call in errno(3)>>>"no such process"
;syscall API's for for the interface between the user and the OS kernel 

;ABOUT ERRNO

;errno.h defines the integer of the variable errno to specify the error that happened
;errno cannot be seted to 0 bym any syscall
